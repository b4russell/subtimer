Subtimer
=======

Subtimer serves a single-page app for tracking the playing times of players on a team. The app is served as a static page; all computation is client side and timing/team data is kept in local storage. You can see it in action at <http://subtimer.herokuapp.com>.  To use it:

    node server.js
